# This policy allows traffic from specific IP blocks and namespaces while limiting access to only selected ports. It is configured for both ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) traffic control.

# Explanation:

  # podSelector: Targets pods labeled app=my-app.
  # policyTypes: Defines both Ingress and Egress rules.

# ingress:
  # Allows traffic from pods with role=backend in the same namespace.
  # Allows traffic from namespaces labeled team=dev-team.
  # Allows traffic from the IP range 192.168.1.0/24 but excludes the IP 192.168.1.5.
  # Limiting incoming traffic to TCP port 8080.

# egress:
  # Limits outgoing traffic to the IP range 10.0.0.0/16.
  # Restricts outgoing traffic to TCP port 443 (e.g., HTTPS) and UDP port 53 (e.g., DNS).
  # These policies provide a foundation for securing inter-pod communication and restricting access based on IPs, namespaces, and ports.
